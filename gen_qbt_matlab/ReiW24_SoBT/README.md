Code, Data and Results for Numerical Experiments in "Data-driven 
balanced truncation for second-order systems with generalized proportional 
damping"
===========================================================================

This archive contains the companion codes, data and computed results for 
the paper:

S. Reiter, S. W. R. Werner; "Data-driven 
 balanced truncation for second-order systems with generalized proportional 
 damping"

which implement numerical experiments using intrusive and data-driven 
(non-intrusive) methods for the structured and unstructured surrogate 
modeling of second-order linear dynamical systems. 


## Dependencies and Installation

The code was tested on a on a MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and an Apple M2 
processor running macOS Ventura version 13.4 with MATLAB 23.2.0.2515942 
(R2023b) Update 7.
The MORLABâ€”The Model Order Reduction LABoratory version 6.0 is used to 
compute the intrusive reduced-order models via first-order and second-order
position-velocity balanced truncation.


## Getting Started

The `runme*.m` files can be used to reproduce experiments from Section 6 of 
the companion paper. The scripts correspond to the following experiments:

* `runme_sobutterfly`: experiments involving the butterfly gyroscope 
  benchmark
* `runme_soplate`: experiments involving the plate with tuned vibration 
  absorbers
* `runme_somsd`: experiments involving the mass-spring-damper network

The results computed by these scripts will be saved to the `results`
folder. Existing results will be overwritten.
